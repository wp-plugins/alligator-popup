Links can be added to pages/posts via a shortcode and will be opened in a popup window.

## USAGE: ##
Add a shortcode where you would like the link to the popup to appear within your post or page text. The shortcode will be in the format:

`[popup url="http://cubecolour.co.uk/wp" height="300" width="300"]Link Text[/popup]`

Put in Your Link Text, url, width & height. If no values are given for height and width, defaults of 400px are used.

## Note: ##
If you are using any other plugin (or a theme) that uses a shortcode with the name 'popup', you will not be able to use this plugin.
